				Auditing the current App from the UX/UI point of view to detect points of improvement
			</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6 padding-right-15">
					<p>
						First off, we took a close look at how the current app was built. We examined everything from
						how easy it was to navigate to how intuitive the controls were. Basically, we wanted to make
						sure using the app is a breeze for everyone.
					</p>
					<p>

						At the same time we dived into the UI design. This involved scrutinising the layout, colour
						scheme, fonts, and overall visual appeal. We wanted the app to not only function well but also
						look consistent while doing it.
					</p>
					<p>

						As part of the audit, we also compared the app to the similar ones we found in the market during
						the competitors analysis. This helped us identify areas where we could improve and ways we can
						stand out from the competition.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we've gathered all the data, we compiled a comprehensive report with our findings. This
						included recommendations for tweaks and enhancements to enhance the overall user experience,
						specially the onboarding one.

					<p>
						Together with the Head of Product and Project Manager, we created a spreadhseet as a script with questions we wanted responses of to use as guidelines when doing the interviews. Our point of view on that was that we didn’t want that to become a formal interview, and more a space to share and have an open conversation. By the first 6 interviews, we detected almost 80% of the pain points the user was finding when using and investing in the app.

					<ul class="">

						<li class="margin-bottom-30">
							<strong>More updates of what was happening behind scenes.</strong> Even if there wasn’t a major update on the REIT, the users wanted to know what we were up to and what we were working at.
						</li>

						<li>
							<strong>REIT performance.</strong> Some users were tracking the REIT performance by themselves by having spreadsheets where they were taking notes of how their investment was performing.
