						At the same time we dived into the UI design. This involved scrutinising the layout, colour

						look consistent while doing it.
					</p>
					<p>

						As part of the audit, we also compared the app to the similar ones we found in the market during
						the competitors analysis. This helped us identify areas where we could improve and ways we can
						stand out from the competition.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we've gathered all the data, we compiled a comprehensive report with our findings. This
						included recommendations for tweaks and enhancements to enhance the overall user experience,

						Together with the Head of Product and Project Manager, we created a spreadhseet as a script with questions we wanted responses of to use as guidelines when doing the interviews. Our point of view on that was that we didn’t want that to become a formal interview, and more a space to share and have an open conversation. By the first 6 interviews, we detected almost 80% of the pain points the user was finding when using and investing in the app.

Establishing visual design and fixing the usability issues detected during the research phase
		</h2>

		<p>
			One of the most glaring issues I noticed when I joined the team was the lack of design consistency throughout the app. From paddings to margins to font sizes, the app was not built according to UX/UI standards. To address this inconsistency and ensure a more cohesive user experience, we implemented a Design System. This system was established to provide a sense of reliability and trustworthiness in the app for users.

					An example of how we improved interface and usability is evident in the Onboarding screen, specifically when prompting the user to enter their phone number. In this instance, we made several enhancements. Firstly, we minimized user actions by automatically displaying the keyboard once the user accesses the screen. This not only streamlines the process but also establishes a clear visual hierarchy, making it easier for users to identify where to input their information. Additionally, we provided an explanation of why we require this information, thereby increasing transparency and potentially boosting conversion rates. Lastly, we offered assistance to users to further facilitate the process.
